Hi, my name is <em> kashish </em>.
<p>
I am from Punjab, one of the state in India.Punjabi is my mother-tongue although I am capable of speaking fluent English. This is my second semester in Columbia College in Associate of Arts in psychology concentration. I am an extrovert personality so I love to interact with different kinds of people. I pursue this course because I want to know more about world web page and uses of javascript and HTML as well as about other information that we get from internet.
